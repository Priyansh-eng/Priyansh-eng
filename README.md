I'm Priyansh — a Data Analyst by day, an AI & Data Science enthusiast by night, and an innovator in every moment in between. Oh, and if you're wondering, I can decode data patterns better than Sherlock deciphers clues, no magnifying glass needed! 🧙‍♂️🔍
Over the past two years, I've been on a thrilling journey, transforming raw data into compelling stories for startups 🚀. My journey has been about charting the uncharted, turning the 'what ifs' into tangible 'what's next,' with a portfolio that spans across 10+ brands as an independent consultant.
My Playground?
Digital realms where data speaks louder than words, connecting dots from across the spectrum of industries to reveal insights that propel us from insights to action, spanning the diverse landscapes of finance, e-commerce, and beyond.
Achievements in Numbers?
At SCMIA, I spearheaded game-changing strides in medical image analysis, employing AI and OpenCV to redefine diagnostics and uplift patient care. Utilising cutting-edge deep learning, I boosted diagnostic accuracy by 30% and slashed patient wait times by 25%. Through collaborative teamwork, our solutions are poised to revolutionise healthcare globally.
What's Brewing?
Currently, I'm embarking on a solopreneurial adventure, crafting data-centric solutions one byte at a time. Sharing the magic of AI, data analysis, and the wonders of technological innovation with budding professionals fuels my belief in a future where challenges are merely stepping stones to greater achievements 🌱📘.
I am eager to connect with professionals and organisations that are at the intersection of data science and innovation. Whether it's discussing potential collaborations, sharing insights, or exploring new opportunities, excited to connect.
